Having ,Order by,Group By :-
=============================

Group by :- 
-------------
Gathering information for a group of records which are grouped based on some criteria.

Eg:- To find the average sales done by sales person , we are using group by on salesperson column and average the Totalsale for that person .

SELECT Salesperson, AVG(TotalSale)
 FROM SALES
 GROUP BY Salesperson;
 
 Having :- 
-----------
To filter records on multiple records rather than on single records, having clause is used .

SELECT Salesperson, SUM(TotalSale)
 FROM SALES
 GROUP BY Salesperson
 HAVING Salesperson <>'Bennett';
 
 here the sales are grouped by salesperson and to filter out the records to not include sales of salesperson by name 'Bennett'.
 
 
 Order By :-
 --------
 Order by is used to either order the records based on column either in asc or desc order .

 SELECT * FROM SALES ORDER BY SaleDate ;

Note :- by default asc order is selected .
